# TMDB Companion API — Project Proposal

## What I Built

This project is a custom REST API built with Flask that integrates with
The Movie Database (TMDB). The API allows users to search for movies and TV shows,
view trending content, fetch details, and manage session-based interactions.

The goal was to design and implement a real backend API that runs locally,
uses a database, integrates an external service, and is fully documented
and testable.

## Why This Fits the Theme

This project demonstrates:
- Designing an API from scratch
- Integrating a third-party API
- Using a database for persistence
- Implementing authentication workflows
- Documenting and testing endpoints

---

## Tools Used

- Python / Flask
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Flasgger (Swagger UI)
- Flask-Caching
- TMDB API
- Postman

---

## Development Timeline (Estimated)

- Design & planning: ~1 day
- Environment & database setup: ~0.5 day
- Core API endpoints: ~2 days
- Authentication & sessions: ~1 day
- Documentation & testing: ~1 day

---

## Success Criteria

- API runs locally without errors
- Endpoints return valid TMDB data
- Database is used for persistence
- Swagger documentation loads correctly
- API can be tested using Postman
